## Description (10 Marks)

Welcome to Dungeon Slayer where you will go from Rags to Riches. Welcome to the Kingdom of Inverness. You find yourself in the Kingdom of Aavak, the infamous kingdom known for its thievery and mischievousness. It is there that you hear of “the legend of the Phoenix ''. The legend where the former King of Aavak went on a conquest to defeat the majestic fiery Phoenix. After months of waiting, Aavak's king never returned and was presumed deceased. A struggle for the throne began and after months of fighting, murder and mischief. The High King of Inverness traveled to the town of Aavak. After his arrival he concluded to the townspeople of Aavak, that whoever was willing to fight the Phoenix and return the crown of Aavak, was promised the City of Aavak and the princesses hand in marriage. 

This is where your journey starts, a race to wealth and riches.
